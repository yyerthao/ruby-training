# ------- RECAP
# variables are used in snake case, not camel case
#
# global variables will be defined with a $, hopefully no need to ever use
#
# methods are defined using the def keyword
#   should indent space with 2 spaces, not tab
#
# no need to specifically return a value, this will automatically happen with the last value of the method
#
#
# input and output can be done with gets/puts/print
#
# call out to the system with backticks or >> system << method
